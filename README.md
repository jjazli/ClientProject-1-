## Ethical Considerations

- **Data Confidentiality**: The dataset analyzed in this project is anonymized to protect sensitive information. No identifiable information about individual videos or users is included in the analysis or outputs.
- **Responsible Reporting**: Insights and visualizations are generalized and abstracted to ensure they are non-attributable to the source data.
- **Transparency**: This project follows ethical guidelines for data handling, ensuring compliance with data usage agreements and privacy standards.

# Video Engagement Analysis

This project involves analyzing TikTok video performance data to uncover trends in viewer engagement, optimal posting times, and the impact of video length on retention. The analysis was performed using Python with advanced data cleaning, visualization, and statistical techniques.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Handled missing values and ensured data consistency.
  - Removed duplicates and filtered outliers using Z-scores.
  - Created derived metrics such as Engagement Rate to enrich insights.

- **Visualizations**:
  - **Scatter Plot**: Relationship between video duration and average watch time.
  - **Correlation Heatmap**: Highlighting relationships between key metrics.
  - **Line Charts**: Time-based trends in viewer engagement.
  - **Interactive Elements**: Tooltips and dynamic mean lines for better interpretation.

- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - Identified and visualized outliers for deeper analysis.
  - Examined correlations to understand the interplay of metrics.

## Key Insights (Abstracted)

- **Optimal Video Length**:
  Both short and long videos can perform well, but content quality and relevance are key factors in driving engagement.

- **Posting Time**:
  Engagement peaks during specific times, such as lunchtime and evening hours, suggesting strategic opportunities for content posting.

- **Viewer Retention**:
  Retaining viewers in the first few seconds is crucial, emphasizing the need for compelling video openings.
